        <h2>Description of the recipe</h2>
            <p>Tofu is an incredible source of protein and mixing it in a stir fry is a quick and easy choice. My love for this recipe came from a restaurant, which served tofu stir fry and I instantly fell in love with it. The recipe is described as nutritious, filling and flavourful, which counts towards your five a day. Also, did I mention this recipe is vegan?</p>

                    <li>Whisk coconut milk, peanut butter, soy sauce, brown sugar, lime juice, Sriracha sauce, and ground chili pepper together in a bowl until a smooth sauce forms.</li>
                    <li>Heat oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add carrots and bell pepper; sauté until just tender, 1 to 2 minutes. Add tofu and sauté until lightly browned, about 4 minutes per side. Add garlic and ginger; cook and stir until fragrant, about 30 seconds.</li>
                    <li>Pour sauce into the skillet and stir to coat tofu and vegetables. Cook until flavors combine, about 5 minutes. Reduce the heat to low, then stir in spinach, 1 cup at a time, until wilted. Serve over brown rice.</li>
